# TensorOS

What is TensorOS?

        TensorOS is a hobby OS fully written in assembly language by MarcoIK. Its purpose is to implement it into embedded,              learnable systems. It is build from scratch and is also independent from other Operating Systems.
        Currently there are some small features, but it is not comparable with other well-known Operating Systems. It includes an         own bootloader, memory management, task scheduler, networking (IPv4), example applications and true multitasking.
        It is distributed under the MIT License - see the accompanying COPYING file for more details.
        
Which Hardware is supported?

        Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs,
        today TensorOS also runs on (at least) the PowerPC, PowerPC64, ARM, Intel IA-64, AMD x86-64 and AVR32.
        TensorOS is portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures
        as long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU).

Documentation:

        - You can find some README files in each subdirectory:
          these typically contain explanations for the existing source code and
          all source files contain short informations about the code in the header 
          sections.
        - In the documentation subdirectory are all necessary guides for developer.
          These guides can be rendered in txt format.
